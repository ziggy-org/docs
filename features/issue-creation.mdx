title: "Issue Creation"
description: "Create well-structured Jira issues from Slack conversations"
---

## Overview

Issue creation is Ziggy's core feature. Mention Ziggy in any Slack message or thread, and it will create a complete Jira issue with:

- Structured summary and description
- Appropriate issue type (Bug, Task, Story, Improvement)
- Priority level
- Context from the thread
- Link back to the Slack conversation

## Basic Usage

Mention Ziggy with a description of what you need:

```
@Ziggy the checkout page is broken on mobile, can you file a bug?
```

```
@Ziggy we need a task to update the onboarding flow
```

```
@Ziggy can you open a story for the new dashboard Sarah mentioned?
```

## Trigger Words

Ziggy recognizes these action words:

- `create`
- `open`
- `file`
- `report`

## Specifying Details

### Priority

Include priority naturally:

```
@Ziggy this is urgent - users can't reset their passwords
```

```
@Ziggy low priority but we should track it - the footer link is wrong
```

Priority levels: Highest, High, Medium, Low, Lowest

### Project

Override the default project inline:

```
@Ziggy bug in MOBILE - the app crashes when you upload a photo
```

```
@Ziggy can you create a task in BACKEND for the API refactor?
```

### Assignee

Assign the issue during creation:

```
@Ziggy create a task for this and assign it to @sarah
```

```
@Ziggy this is a bug for John - the login page is timing out
```

## Thread Context

When you mention Ziggy in a thread, it reads:

1. The root message
2. All replies in the thread
3. Files and images shared

This context is used to:
- Extract requirements and acceptance criteria
- Identify reproduction steps for bugs
- Capture decisions and constraints discussed

## What Gets Created

### For Bugs

- **Summary** - Clear bug title
- **Description**:
  - Context / Background
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Expected vs actual behavior
  - Environment details (if mentioned)
- **Attachments** - Screenshots and files from the thread
- **Slack link** - Permalink to the original conversation

### For Tasks / Stories

- **Summary** - Clear task title
- **Description**:
  - Context / Background
  - Requirements
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Open questions (if any)
- **Attachments** - Relevant files from the thread
- **Slack link** - Permalink to the original conversation

## Duplicate Detection

Ziggy can check for similar existing issues before creating new ones. This is off by default for faster results, but you can turn it on in the **Home** tab under settings.

When enabled:

1. Ziggy searches for similar issues before creating
2. If potential duplicates are found, Ziggy shows them to you
3. You can choose to view them or create anyway

This adds a few seconds to each request but helps keep your backlog clean.
