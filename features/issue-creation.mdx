description: "Create well-structured Jira issues from Slack conversations"

## Overview

Issue creation is Ziggy's core feature. Mention Ziggy in any Slack message or thread, and it will create a complete Jira issue with:

- Structured summary and description
- Appropriate issue type (Bug, Task, Story, Improvement)
- Priority level
- Context from the thread
- Link back to the Slack conversation

## Basic Usage

Mention Ziggy with a description of what you need:

```
Ziggy create a task for the login page redesign
```

```
Ziggy file a bug for the checkout crash
```

```
Ziggy open a story for the new dashboard feature
```

## Trigger Words

Ziggy recognizes these action words:

- `create`
- `open`
- `file`
- `report`

## Specifying Details

### Priority

Include priority in your request:

```
Ziggy high priority bug: users can't reset passwords
```

```
Ziggy create an urgent task for the deployment
```

Priority levels: Highest, High, Medium, Low, Lowest

### Project

Override the default project inline:

```
Ziggy in MOBILE: create a bug for the app crash
```

```
Ziggy create a task in BACKEND for the API refactor
```

### Assignee

Assign the issue during creation:

```
Ziggy create a task and assign to @sarah
```

```
Ziggy bug for the login issue, assign to John
```

## Thread Context

When you mention Ziggy in a thread, it reads:

1. The root message
2. All replies in the thread
3. Files and images shared

This context is used to:
- Extract requirements and acceptance criteria
- Identify reproduction steps for bugs
- Capture decisions and constraints discussed

## What Gets Created

### For Bugs

- **Summary**: Clear bug title
- **Description**:
  - Context / Background
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Expected vs actual behavior
  - Environment details (if mentioned)
- **Attachments**: Screenshots and files from the thread
- **Slack link**: Permalink to the original conversation

### For Tasks / Stories

- **Summary**: Clear task title
- **Description**:
  - Context / Background
  - Requirements
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Open questions (if any)
- **Attachments**: Relevant files from the thread
- **Slack link**: Permalink to the original conversation

## Duplicate Detection

Before creating an issue, Ziggy searches for similar existing issues. If potential duplicates are found:

1. Ziggy shows you the similar issues
2. You can choose to view them or create anyway
3. This prevents duplicate work and keeps your backlog clean
