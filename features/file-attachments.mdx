description: "Automatically attach files from Slack to Jira issues"

## Overview

When you create a Jira issue from a Slack thread, any files shared in that thread are automatically uploaded as attachments to the new issue.

## Supported Files

Ziggy handles common file types:

- **Images** — PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG
- **Documents** — PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint
- **Code** — Text files, logs, JSON
- **Screenshots** — Pasted images in Slack

## How It Works

1. You share files in a Slack thread
2. When you ask Ziggy to create an issue, it detects all files in the thread
3. Files are downloaded from Slack and uploaded to the new Jira issue
4. Attachments appear in the issue's Attachments section

## Example

**Thread:**
> User: The button is misaligned on mobile
> User: [screenshot-1.png]
> User: [screenshot-2.png]
> Dev: What browser?
> User: Safari on iOS 17

**Command:**
```
Ziggy create a bug for this
```

**Result:** Bug created with both screenshots attached, plus repro details in the description.

## Notes

- File uploads happen after the issue is created (non-blocking)
- Large files may take a moment to upload
- Files are only attached from the specific thread, not the entire channel
