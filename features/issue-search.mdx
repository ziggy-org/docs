## Overview

Search your Jira backlog directly from Slack. Ziggy returns matching issues with key details so you can quickly find what you're looking for.

## Basic Usage

```
Ziggy find issues about login
```

```
Ziggy search for payment bugs
```

```
Ziggy check if there's an issue for the API timeout
```

## Trigger Words

Ziggy recognizes these search actions:

- `find`
- `search`
- `check`
- `look for`

## Search Results

Ziggy returns up to 5 matching issues with:

- **Issue key** — Clickable link to Jira (e.g., PROJ-123)
- **Summary** — Issue title
- **Status** — Current workflow status
- **Priority** — Issue priority level
- **Assignee** — Who it's assigned to

## Examples

```
Ziggy find open bugs in MOBILE
```

```
Ziggy search for issues assigned to @sarah
```

```
Ziggy check for existing issues about the checkout flow
```

## Tips

- Be specific with keywords to get better results
- Use project keys to narrow scope: `Ziggy find bugs in BACKEND`
- Search before creating to avoid duplicates
