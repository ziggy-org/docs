## Overview

Search your Jira backlog directly from Slack. Ziggy returns matching issues with key details so you can quickly find what you're looking for.

## Basic Usage

```
@Ziggy are there any issues about the login page?
```

```
@Ziggy search for payment bugs
```

```
@Ziggy check if someone already filed something about the API timeout
```

## Trigger Words

Ziggy recognizes these search actions:

- `find`
- `search`
- `check`
- `look for`

## Search Results

Ziggy returns up to 5 matching issues with:

- **Issue key** - Clickable link to Jira (e.g., PROJ-123)
- **Summary** - Issue title
- **Status** - Current workflow status
- **Priority** - Issue priority level
- **Assignee** - Who it's assigned to

## Examples

```
@Ziggy find any open bugs in MOBILE
```

```
@Ziggy what's assigned to @sarah right now?
```

```
@Ziggy check if there's already something about the checkout flow
```

## Tips

- Be specific with keywords to get better results
- Use project keys to narrow scope: `@Ziggy find bugs in BACKEND`
- Search before creating to avoid duplicates
