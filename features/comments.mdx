description: "Add comments to Jira issues from Slack"
---

## Overview

Add comments to existing Jira issues without leaving Slack. Great for adding updates, context, or decisions from ongoing conversations.

## Basic Usage

```
@Ziggy add a comment to PROJ-123 - testing is done, all good
```

```
@Ziggy comment on BACKEND-456 saying we reviewed this and it's approved
```

```
@Ziggy note on MOBILE-789 that the fix went out to production
```

## Trigger Words

- `add comment to`
- `comment on`
- `note on`

## How It Works

1. Ziggy extracts the issue key and comment text
2. The comment is formatted in Atlassian Document Format (ADF)
3. Comment is added to the Jira issue
4. Ziggy confirms the comment was added

## Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Status update">
    ```
    @Ziggy comment on PROJ-123 - we're blocked waiting for the API changes, should be unblocked next week
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Decision from thread">
    After a Slack discussion about approach:
    ```
    @Ziggy add a comment to PROJ-456 - team decided to go with WebSockets instead of polling
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Deployment note">
    ```
    @Ziggy note on PROJ-789 that this just went to staging for QA
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tips

- Keep comments concise but include enough context
- Reference the Slack thread if the comment needs more background
- Use comments to keep stakeholders updated on progress
