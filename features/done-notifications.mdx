description: "Get notified in Slack when issues are resolved"

## Overview

When a Jira issue created by Ziggy is resolved, Ziggy posts a notification back to the original Slack thread. This closes the loop and keeps everyone informed.

## How It Works

1. You create a Jira issue via Ziggy in a Slack thread
2. Someone resolves the issue in Jira (moves to "Done" or similar)
3. Ziggy detects the status change via webhook
4. A notification is posted to the original Slack thread

## Notification Message

When an issue is resolved, you'll see:

> ✅ **PROJ-123** is resolved. One less thing to worry about.
>
> [View in Jira]

The notification includes:
- Issue key with link to Jira
- "View in Jira" button for quick access

## Supported Statuses

Ziggy sends notifications when issues transition to "Done" status. This works with:

- Standard Jira "Done" status
- Custom "Done" statuses in your workflow
- Any status in the "Done" category

## Notes

- Notifications only appear for issues created through Ziggy
- The notification goes to the exact thread where the issue was created
- Team members following the thread will see the update
