## Overview

Assign or reassign existing Jira issues without opening Jira. Just mention the issue key and the person.

## Basic Usage

```
Ziggy assign PROJ-123 to @john
```

```
Ziggy reassign BACKEND-456 to Sarah
```

```
Ziggy give MOBILE-789 to @mike
```

## Trigger Words

- `assign`
- `reassign`
- `give`

## How It Works

1. Ziggy extracts the issue key and assignee name from your message
2. For Slack mentions, Ziggy looks up the user's email to find their Jira account
3. For plain names, Ziggy searches Jira users
4. The issue is assigned and Ziggy confirms the change

## User Matching

Ziggy matches users in this order:

1. **Slack mention** (`@john`) — Uses the linked email to find the Jira user
2. **Name match** — Searches Jira users by display name

<Tip>Using Slack mentions is more reliable since it matches by email address.</Tip>

## Examples

```
Ziggy assign PROJ-123 to @sarah
```
→ Assigns PROJ-123 to Sarah (matched by Slack email)

```
Ziggy reassign BACKEND-456 to Mike Chen
```
→ Searches for "Mike Chen" in Jira users and assigns

```
Ziggy give MOBILE-789 to the mobile team lead
```
→ Ziggy will ask for clarification if the name is ambiguous
