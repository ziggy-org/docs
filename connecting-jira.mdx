description: "Link your Jira Cloud instance to Ziggy"

## Requirements

Before connecting Jira, ensure you have:

- **Jira Cloud** — Ziggy works with Jira Cloud (not Jira Server or Data Center)
- **Jira permissions** — You need permission to authorize third-party apps in your Jira instance

## Connect via OAuth

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the connection">
    In any Slack channel, type:
    ```
    /ziggy connect
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorize in Atlassian">
    Click the authorization link. You'll be redirected to Atlassian to grant Ziggy access.

    Ziggy requests permission to:
    - Read and write issues
    - Read projects and issue types
    - Upload attachments
    - Read and write comments
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirmation">
    Once authorized, Ziggy will confirm the connection in Slack and start your 14-day free trial.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Check connection status

To verify your Jira connection at any time:

```
/ziggy status
```

This shows:
- Connection status
- Connected Jira site
- Default project (if set)
- Subscription status and trial days remaining

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Authorization failed">
    Ensure you have permission to authorize third-party apps in your Jira instance. Contact your Jira admin if needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Wrong Jira instance connected">
    If you connected the wrong Jira instance, contact support@ziggy.sh to reset your connection.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't see my projects">
    Ziggy can only access projects that the authorizing user has access to. Make sure you have the necessary Jira permissions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security

- Ziggy uses OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication
- Credentials are encrypted at rest
- Ziggy only accesses Jira when explicitly triggered by a user mention
- All data is scoped to your workspace — no cross-tenant access
