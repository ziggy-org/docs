## Three steps to your first Jira ticket

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Ziggy">
    Add Ziggy to your Slack workspace from [ziggy.sh](https://ziggy.sh).

    You'll need to authorize Ziggy to:
    - Read messages where Ziggy is mentioned
    - Post messages in channels
    - Access files shared in conversations
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect Jira">
    In any Slack channel, type `/ziggy connect` and follow the OAuth flow to connect your Jira Cloud instance.

    <Note>Connecting Jira starts your 14-day free trial.</Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create your first ticket">
    In any Slack thread, mention Ziggy:

    ```
    Ziggy create a task for this
    ```

    Ziggy will read the thread context and create a complete Jira issue.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What happens next

Once you create your first ticket, Ziggy will:

1. React with an eyes emoji to acknowledge your request
2. Read the thread and gather context
3. Extract issue details using AI
4. Check for duplicate issues
5. Create the Jira issue
6. Post a confirmation with a link to the new issue

## Set your default project

To skip the project selection step, set a default project in the Ziggy **Home** tab. Open Ziggy in the Apps section of your Slack sidebar and click **Home** to configure your default project.

<Tip>You can always override the default by specifying a project inline: `@Ziggy in PROJ: create a task`</Tip>
