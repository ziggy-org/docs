## Say it in Slack. Ziggy handles Jira.

Ziggy is a Slack agent that turns any message or thread into a complete, high-quality Jira ticket in about 10 seconds — with the right context, fields, and formatting.

## The Problem

Teams waste hours on "work about work" inside Slack:

- Bug reports appear in threads and never make it to Jira
- PMs ask for feature changes that get lost in chat
- Someone says "can you open a Jira?" and it doesn't happen — or it happens badly
- Important thread context stays in Slack and never makes it into the ticket

## What Ziggy Creates

When you ask Ziggy to create a ticket, it generates:

- **Summary** — Clear, concise title (max 255 characters)
- **Description** — Structured content with context, requirements, and acceptance criteria
- **Issue Type** — Bug, Task, Story, or Improvement based on context
- **Priority** — Extracted from the conversation or explicitly requested
- **Attachments** — Files shared in the thread are automatically uploaded
- **Slack Link** — Permalink back to the original conversation
