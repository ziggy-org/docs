## Overview

Ziggy uses a project resolution system to determine which Jira project to create issues in. You can set defaults at the workspace and personal level.

## Project Resolution Priority

When you create an issue, Ziggy determines the project in this order:

1. **Inline specification** — `Ziggy in PROJ: create a task`
2. **Personal default** — Set via `/ziggy my-project`
3. **Workspace default** — Set via `/ziggy setup`
4. **Most active project** — Falls back to the most recently used project

## Setting Workspace Default

Workspace admins can set a default project for all users:

```
/ziggy setup PROJ
```

This is useful when:
- Your team primarily works in one project
- You want a consistent default for new team members
- You want to ensure issues go to the right place by default

## Setting Personal Default

Each user can set their own default:

```
/ziggy my-project MYPROJ
```

Personal defaults are useful when:
- Different team members work on different projects
- You want to override the workspace default for your own issues
- You frequently create issues in a specific project

## Inline Override

Always specify the project in your message to override any defaults:

```
Ziggy in BACKEND: create a bug for the API timeout
```

```
Ziggy create a task in MOBILE for the app crash
```

## Examples

### Scenario 1: Single-project team

A small team all working on the same project:

1. Admin sets workspace default: `/ziggy setup ACME`
2. All team members create issues without specifying project
3. All issues go to ACME

### Scenario 2: Multi-project organization

A larger org with multiple teams:

1. Admin sets workspace default: `/ziggy setup GENERAL`
2. Frontend team sets personal defaults: `/ziggy my-project FRONTEND`
3. Backend team sets personal defaults: `/ziggy my-project BACKEND`
4. Issues automatically route to the right project based on who creates them

### Scenario 3: Cross-team collaboration

When creating an issue for another team:

```
Ziggy in MOBILE: create a bug for the iOS crash @mobileteam mentioned
```

The inline `in MOBILE:` overrides any defaults.

## Viewing Current Settings

Check your current project configuration:

```
/ziggy status
```

Shows both workspace default and your personal default.
