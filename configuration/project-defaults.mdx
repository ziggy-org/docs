## Overview

Ziggy uses a project resolution system to determine which Jira project to create issues in. You can set defaults using the **Home** tab in Slack.

## Project Resolution Priority

When you create an issue, Ziggy determines the project in this order:

1. **Inline specification** - `Ziggy in PROJ: create a task`
2. **Default project** - Set via the Home tab
3. **Most active project** - Falls back to the most recently used project

## Setting Default Project

Open the Ziggy **Home** tab in Slack and configure your default project there. This is where you manage all project settings.

## Inline Override

Specify the project in your message to override any defaults:

```
Ziggy in BACKEND: create a bug for the API timeout
```

```
Ziggy create a task in MOBILE for the app crash
```

## Examples

### Scenario 1: Single-project team

A small team all working on the same project:

1. Set default project to ACME in the Home tab
2. All team members create issues without specifying project
3. All issues go to ACME

### Scenario 2: Cross-team collaboration

When creating an issue for another team:

```
Ziggy in MOBILE: create a bug for the iOS crash @mobileteam mentioned
```

The inline `in MOBILE:` overrides any defaults.

## Viewing Current Settings

Check your current project configuration:

```
/ziggy status
```

Or open the Ziggy **Home** tab to see and change your defaults.
